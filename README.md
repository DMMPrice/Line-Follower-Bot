# Line-Follower-Bot
In this workshop, we have learnt, how to make a basic autonomous bot . While making the autonomous bot, we came to know about Arduino , the IR sensors, Ultrasonic transducer and how they works. We have connected them with the help of bread board and ran the code with the help of Arduino software . Lastly, we have connected two motor and wheels and completed our bot. It is mainly line following bot. 
We have to remember that
1. The connection should be done in proper manner
2. The ultrasonic transducer should be placed on the bread board and should be kept in the front of the bot so that it can transmit and receive wave easily
3. The IR sensors should be kept in front of bot and below the ultrasonic transducer so that it can sense the line to be followed
4. After the connection place an object and move it to and fro ...if the LED light will on then , we can assure that IR sensors are working appropriately
